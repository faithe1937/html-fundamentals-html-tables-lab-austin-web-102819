  <!-- Write your HTML here -->
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Phone Number</th>
    <th>Bringing</th>
  </tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr></tr>
  <tr></tr>
</table>
Even though we write the HTML from top down, we would see these headers in bold and lined up left to right. We can spin up httpserver or directly open index.html right now to take a look.

This first row is almost always the only place where we use the th tag.

The Table Data Tag: <td>
In the second row, we can start putting in our data. Here, we want to use the table data tag, <td> instead of using the table header tag. The <td> tag represents one table cell. So, for our party table, we can add in some names, phone numbers and items for guests to bring. An example row would look like the following:

<tr>
  <td>Daniel</td>
  <td>845-282-4000</td>
  <td>Guacamole</td>
</tr>
As long as each bit of data in a <td> is in the same position as the corresponding <th> in the first row, it will show up in that column.

Repeating this structure, if we wanted to include 3 guests for our party, our entire table would look like the following:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Name</th>
    <th>Phone Number</th>
    <th>Bringing</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Daniel</td>
    <td>718-555-1212</td>
    <td>Guacamole</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Rachel</td>
    <td>718-555-1212</td>
    <td>Chips</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Terrance</td>
    <td>914-555-1212</td>
    <td>Salsa</td>
  </tr>
</table>
  
  <table>
  <tr>
    <th>City</th>
    <th>State</th>
    <th>2017 estimate</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>New York</td>
    <td>New York</td>
    <td>8,622,698</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Los Angeles</td>
    <td>California</td>
    <td>3,999,759</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chicago</td>
    <td>Illinois</td>
    <td>2,716,450</td>
  </tr>
</table>
